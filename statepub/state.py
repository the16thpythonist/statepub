    This is the Interface for any new "Sate" object.
    The state objects are meant to describe some sort of current state/value of either the Computer as a whole, a sort
    of Process etc.
    A specific state object has a fixed set of values it represents. How these values are read from the system will be
    hardcoded into them. But the method, which starts this process of getting all the necessary values will have to be
    the same. "acquire" will update the object internal attributes of the object.
    The method "to_dict" will have to return a dictionary of all the values, that are represented by the state object.
    This is necessary to later publish them to their respective MQTT topics. The topic names (at least at the top level)
    will have the same names as the attributes of the state objects.
